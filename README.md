# MCP Python SDK

<strong>Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This Python SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

- Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
- Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
- Use standard transports like stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP
- Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation

### Adding MCP to your python project

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects.

If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

   ```bash
   uv init mcp-server-demo
   cd mcp-server-demo
   ```

   Then add MCP to your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

Alternatively, for projects using pip for dependencies:

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

### Running the standalone MCP development tools

To run the mcp command with uv:

```bash
uv run mcp
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!
